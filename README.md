->The goal of this project is to enable students and faculty of various colleges / institutes / universities across India to use Open Source Software tools for all their statistical computing and graphical purposes. Therefore, improving the quality of instruction and learning, and avoiding expensive commercial computing licenses for research and education.

->So, here is the link of my codes available at r.fossee.in
