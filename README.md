# TextBook-Companion-Project-in-R

##This is my First contribution to the Open Source Projects in which i have completed the Textbook Companion Project.

In this I have coded a Standard Textbook in R language.

The project is the initiative by FOSSEE,IIT Bombay to promote the Free and Open Source Softwares for Education.

The goal of this project is to enable students and faculty of various colleges / institutes / universities across India to use Open Source Software tools for all their statistical computing and graphical purposes. Therefore, improving the quality of instruction and learning, and avoiding expensive commercial computing licenses for research and education.

So, here is the link of my codes available at r.fossee.in

It will be helpfull to all who are beginner in R language or wants to pursue the carrier in Data Science field these codes will help them to learn and implement the Statistic and Probaility Concepts in R language.
